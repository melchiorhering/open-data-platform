# RUSTFS LOCAL DEV CONFIGURATION

# The default is 4, which is heavy for a laptop. 1 is sufficient for testing.
replicaCount: 3

# 2. Reduce Storage
# 10Gi is unnecessary for local smoke testing.
storage:
  size: 1Gi

# 3. Developer Credentials
# Set simple keys so you don't have to grep secrets every time you restart.
auth:
  accessKey: "admin"
  secretKey: "password123"

# 4. Gateway Hostnames
# Explicitly define your local subdomains here.
# Helmfile injects the Gateway Name/Namespace, so we just set the hosts.

    s3: "s3.localhost"
    console: "console.localhost"
